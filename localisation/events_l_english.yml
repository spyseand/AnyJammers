 germany.1.t:0 "NSDAP Defiant"
 germany.1.d:0 "The NSDAP have begun a large-scale mutiny against the government after the attempt to dissolve the party. The remaining loyal Wehrmacht is trying to take charge of the situation at the present, but seems to be making little to no progess in stopped the uprising. Should Germany fail to supress this impudent show of force, it is likely the nation will collapse into civil war."
 germany.1.a:0 "Declare Martial Law!"
 germany.2.t:0 "The Corporations Rally"
 germany.2.d:0 "Following the NSDAP mutiny, the megacorporations have rallied their allies in the army together to prepare and crush the NSDAP seeing as the current government is failing in their eyes. It has become quite unlikely that these revolts can be crushed, but the situation is still salvagable."
 germany.2.a:0 "Scheisse!"
 germany.3.t:0 "The Red Dawn"
 germany.3.d:0 "Seeing the nation collapse into chaos and facitonalism, the underground network of the left coalition has taken the opportunity to try and seize control themselves. All attempts to quell the unrest have failed and a civil war is all but assured at this point. Little can be done but we shall protect the one thing all Germans can be proud of, Germania."
 germany.3.a:0 "Send the Order!"
 germany.4.t:0 "Wehrmacht Emergency Government"
 germany.4.d:0 "A temporary government has been established in the midst of the current crisis. While we have failed to stave off disaster, we can at least protect some of what's left. Germania has been secured and it seems like numerous edge holdings have also been saved."
 germany.4.a:0 "Let's pray this war end quickly."
 germany.5.t:0 "Allegiances"
 germany.5.d:0 "With the nation on the brink of the civil war, a side must be chosen. Who should the emergency government covertly support?"
 germany.5.a:0 "The Corporations of course! §RYou will tag switch to Corporate Germany upon the start of the war§!"
 germany.5.b:0 "The NSDAP! §RYou will tag switch to NSDAP Germany upon the start of the war§!"
 germany.5.c:0 "The German People! §RYou will tag switch to Peoples' Germany upon the start of the war§!"
 germany.6.t:0 "The German Civil War"
 germany.6.d:0 "After a long and silent morning, the NSDAP began their march to reclaim Germany. Likewise, Peoples' Germany and Corporate Germany also began to move into position. 5 minutes before noon, on the outskirts of Leipzig, the first gunshot fired. The ultimate war to decide the fate of Europe had begun, and there was no stopping it now."
 germany.6.a:0 "To arms!"
 germany.7.t:0 "Border Regions Revolt!"
 germany.7.d:0 "Following the beginning of the German civil war, the various border regions the Wehrmacht was occupying managed to break free of us. Luckily Germania holds strong."
 germany.7.a:0 "They will see vengeance soon..."
 germany.8.t:0 "The Big Four"
 germany.8.d:0 "Ever since the untimely death of Adolf Hitler, there has been no official leader of Germany. It was quickly decided that since had named no successor and that since no one man would ever live up to the title as Hitler had, a sort-of democracy was set up. Of course, it was not one of those sham democracies such as the United States, only NSDAP officials could gain power. One odd side effect saw the leaders of the big four corporations, IG Farben, Siemens, Reichswerke, and Daimler-Benz, and several of their subordinates reach this new board of politicians. After gaining a majority in the board, the four corporations made a separate board of directors of German industry, and while the original council seated by NSDAP members still nominally held power, the real leaders of Germany became the corporations that day. The corporations however still let the NSDAP run the country as they pleased so there were no complaints."
 germany.8.a:0 "An odd alliance."
 germany.9.t:0 "German Decay"
 germany.9.d:0 "Since Hitler's death, Germany has been on a downturn that it still hasn't recovered from. The poverty line keeps getting lowered by the corporate board every year, but everyone knows that poverty has hit rates near 40%. Slavery has stolen jobs from the average German as Italians continue getting abused for free by the corporations. The corporations, however, have a very fanciful facade of social mobility that the German people have bought into.'Perhaps one day i'll make it big and get on that board...' is what runs through the minds of every German. Unforunately, they've fallen for the ruse hook, line, and sinker. This cannot stay as is, the corporations need to be ousted, but who will stand up and take the challenge? The sad answer is no one."
 germany.9.a:0 "A house of cards ready to fall."
 germany.10.t:0 "The Italian Disaster"
 germany.10.d:0 "Following Hitler's declaration of souther lebensraum, Mussolini scrambled to find allies in a newly German dominated Europe, but his cries were heard by none. Germany first marched into sudtyrol, and then Venice, Turin, Milan, Genoa, and finally, once we had reached Bologna, Mussolini was found dead in a bunker in Rome. News spread quickly and Italy collapsed into mayhem. With enough people to feed the slave-based economy and plenty of fine new land for Germans to settle, the German state watched as Italy burned itself to the ground. Declaring German ownership of all of Italy, outside powers were forced to not intervene, but we didn't finish the conquest. Warlords took power in Italian regions and infighting has not stopped since. In a way it was quite a brilliant plan by Hitler, the Italians were cleansing the land for us, and soon we would swoop in and seize even more land for the German people."
 germany.10.a:0 "The fruit is almost ripe."
 germany.11.t:0 "Testing the Wasserstoffbombe"
 germany.11.d:0 "Soon after America unveiled the power of its 'Hydrogen Bomb' to the world, we set our eyes on the raw power of such a weapon. Nearly a decade after America's first testing of the weapon, we have finally finished our own version of it, dubbed the Wasserstoffbombe. The initial test earlier today proved it was as powerful as its American counterpart. We are back in the nuclear race."
 germany.11.a:0 "They shall tremble in their boots."
 germany.12.t:0 "Germany Tests the Wasserstoffbombe"
 germany.12.d:0 "Nearly a decade after the American tests and unveiling of the hydrogen bomb, Germany has finally matched them with a weapon of their own. Both nations now possess modern weapons of mass destruction. While the cold war seemed to have finally been drawing to a close, Germany just renewed the struggle, at the cost of global fear. Hopefully, these weapons are never put to use."
 germany.12.a:0 "Terrifying."
 germany.13.t:0 "Sales Report"
 germany.13.d:0 "Hermann Josef Abs sat in his large chair and sifted through the papers on his desk. Once he finally got to the bottom of today's stack, a final paper rested. As he went over it, a slight smirk formed on his face, but only for a moment. He put the paper back down and reached for the phone on his desk. It was time to begin his plan."
 germany.13.a:0 "Germany will forever change, soon enough."
 germany.14.t:0 "The Trial of Heinrich Himmler"
 germany.14.d:0 "The courtroom bustled with activity as numerous groups shouted slurs and insults at each other. The doors burst open and the room fell silent. Himmler was walked in, escorted by guards, to the front of the room. 'Herr Heinrich Himmler, you are found guilty of undermining the party and are sentenced to death by firing squad.' The room sat silent for another moment, before erupting into screams, arguments, and fights. Himmler was dragged out around the back of the courthouse before several gunshots were heard. Josef Abs swirled whiskey around in his glass with another smirk showing after hearing the gunshots from nearby."
 germany.14.a:0 "A monster put to rest."
 germany.15.t:0 "The Dissolution of the National Socialist German Workers' Party"
 germany.15.d:0 "Following the success of Josef Ab's gambit, he decided to push his luck, as he always had. It was time to ensure his total control and power over the German nation. One final step needed to be taken, he would dissolve the NSDAP permanently. It was risky, and there was a chance he'd ruin the empire he had built over the years, but the payoff was too great to pass up. The time was right. He signed the bill and sent it off."
 germany.15.a:0 "One final gambit."
 germany.16.t:0 "NSDAP Dissolved"
 germany.16.d:0 "The German Corporate Board made the decision a few days ago to officially dissovled the NSDAP. This unprecedented move has shocked the world in a mix of good and bad ways. While the nazi menace would finally be killed, the German coporations built on slavery and crime would instead take over. Whether this will be a good turn of events remains to be seen."
 germany.16.a:0 "A shock to be sure!"
 germany.17.t:0 "The German Civil War"
 germany.17.d:0 "Following rising tensions in the German state, a full-blown civil war has erupted between numerous feuding factions. Initial reports have said the three main factions are that of the NSDAP, led by Martin Bormann, a corporate coalition, led by Hermann Josef Abs, and a democratic revolt, led by Konrad Adenauer. On top of the actual heartland of Germany's land collapsing into civil war, there also seem to be numerous revolts and revolutions on the edges of their empire. This instability in Europe has created a perfect opportunity for outside powers to make important moves, although the question still stands: Will they be willing to risk such intervention?"
 germany.17.a:0 "Nervous eyes watch over Germania."
 germany.18.t:0 "german cw event"
 germany.18.d:0 "i hope you don't see this"
 germany.18.a:0 "well i did"
 germany.19.t:0 "A Fabulous Display"
 germany.19.d:0 "The German Corporate Board has ruled all NSDAP members and all left-wing partisans as enemies of the state, the penalty for which is death. Screams echo through the streets as gunfire rings in every person's ears. A scene even more disturbing than the civil war itself has unfolded right in front of each and every German. Nearly every town, city, and village in Germany has a body pile, some larger than others, but the one thing they have in common is being made up of Germans and the fate they'll soon meet in incinerators."
 germany.19.a:0 "Well deserved."
 germany.20.t:0 "The Centerpiece"
 germany.20.d:0 "A public courtroom was set up in the center of Berlin, with thousands gathered around it. The once most powerful men in Germany, the highest ranking members of the NSDAP, now rest on their knees, hands and legs bound, in front of a content crowd. The corporations had managed to successfully demonize the NSDAP, the very people who brought Germany salvation, and now they were about to end the party once and for all. Bormann looked up, ignoring the judge reading their crimes against Germany. His time was about to come, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. Instead, he smiled, for he was about to rejoin an old friend he hadn't seen in a long time. A tear nearly formed from his eye before it all went black. Bormann's corpse now lay on the stage as the crowd cheered."
 germany.20.a:0 "Another monster gone."
 germany.21.t:0 "Cleaning Up the Mess"
 germany.21.d:0 "With the main opposition to the state eliminated, it was time to begin work on fixing the plights of the German people. The slaves had become severely unmotivated since the leftist revolt promised them freedom, but that wasn't something a smart man like Josef Abs couldn't fix. As well as fixing the production slough, a new bureau of internal affairs was set to be created, although it was to be made via IG Farben and not through the German government. This raised some eyes at the corporate board, but there was nothing they could do about it anyway."
 germany.21.a:0 "A brighter future awaits!"
 germany.22.t:0 "Necessary Diplomacy"
 germany.22.d:0 "While first and foremost a business man, Josef Abs sometimes is required to engage in petty squabbles like politics if only in order to gain a more favorable position for his businesses. Germany's power has been greatly diminished following the end of the civil war and profits have dropped to a near all-time low. With slaves quickly becoming a scarce resource and with large swathes of the German industry being lost, the time has come to once again expand Germany's borders as Hitler did three decades ago. Those who have forgotten their place in this new order will face the wrath of German might as the boot of oppression and progess comes down upon their necks once more."
 germany.22.a:0 "Europe shall burn once more."
 germany.23.t:0 "Modern Worker Motivation"
 germany.23.d:0 "The recent revolts against the corporate system by the slaves in the factories has made it abundantly clear that some more motivation other than simply being provided a continuing life is needed. Josef Abs has a couple of ideas to fix the issue that will be implemented posthaste to get productivity back on track. In a brilliant new scheme, the slaves will be given more motiation than ever, and on top of that, the administators that run the higher positions will also be receiving new incentives to promote a healthier workplace environment."
 germany.23.a:0 "The Fuhrer does it again!"
 germany.24.t:0 "A Game of Monopoly"
 germany.24.d:0 "Hermann Josef Abs, Edmund Geilenberg, Ernst Von Siemens, and Friedrich Flick. The four most powerful men in Germany sat in Josef Ab's office around a modest square table. Josef Abs had called the four for a 'corporate meeting' as he personally put it. \n 'Monopoly anyone? We might as well play some to give this meeting a little flare' Josef Abs slyly suggested to the other three. They sat in silence for a moment wondering if he was joking, but he seemed sincere. \n 'Quite a peculiar suggestion but I suppose I have no reason to decline,' Geilenberg replied giving a quick look to Siemens and Flick; those two seemed to also be in agreement. 'Certainly a funny proposal, given that we're all playing a larger game of monopoly on the global stage, no?' \n Josef Abs chuckled, 'Percisely! I like your thinking Geilenberg. Well then... shall we?' A servant began setting up the board for the men and the time came for each to pick a piece to represent themselves. Josef Abs quickly snatched up the top hat, Geilenberg picked the battleship, Siemens the wheelbarrow, and Flick the car. 'Good luck to each of you; may the best businessman win,' Josef Abs sarcastically said before beginning the game with the first dice roll."
 germany.24.a:0 "The upper class certainly are odd..."
 germany.25.t:0 "Ernst Von Siemens"
 germany.25.d:0 "Siemens lived a cushioned life. After Germany's victory in the second world war, he inherited one of the largest companies in Europe, Siemens-Schuckertweke. In a bout of personal pride, Siemens had managed to keep Siemens on par with the other megacoporations of Germany while limiting his use of slavery to an absolute minimum. While he didn't entirely detest it, he felt tradtional companies were more appropriate for proper businessmen. With a monopoly on the production of medical equipment and electronics and contributing majorly to the aircraft and train industries, Siemens is in a high position of power. Nearly every part of Germany relies on them for something or another, but every powerful entity has some weakness to be exploited. The quality of Siemens' products has deteriorated over the years, and just a small dose of international competition could break Siemens down from the foundations up."
 germany.25.a:0 "A simple problem and a simpler solution."
 germany.26.t:0 "The Wheelbarrow Eliminated"
 germany.26.d:0 "'Scheisse!' Siemens half-shouted after landing on another hotel. He turned his final cash over to Josef Abs and was disappointed for a moment, but another moment later he remembered it was simply a child's game. Perhaps the poor sales in the past couple weeks has messed with him, that new bill the board passed was after all intruding on his market. In earnest, he didn't have time to be playing monopoly and frankly the meetings held by Josef Abs usually amounted to next to nothing. As such, Siemens saw himself out, with his personal bodyguard following. As his limo drove him through the night, it pulled over on the side of the street. 'Why'd you stop! What am I paying you for!?' The driver silently opened the door and motioned for Siemens to step out of the vehicle. 'Hmph, fine. I'll drive myself if you imcompetent nitwits won't drive,' Siemens protested. His bodyguard stopped him before he reached the driver's door, and began forcefully moving Siemens towards a side alleyway. Siemens finally realized... this was it, someone had paid his guard and driver to kidnap or kill him. Thier paychecks had been significantly lowered because of the company's poor preformance recently, but he didn't think it would come to this... In front of him in the alleyway he looked upon three homeless Germans, one dead in a rusted old wheelbarrow, the other two malnourished and barely breathing huddling around a fire in a barrel entirely ignoring the scene unfolding next to them. It was all kind of ironic, he thought, as a luger pressed up against his temple. Blood painted the alleyway, and a fresh corpse was left as the limo once more drove forward."
 germany.26.a:0 "..."
 germany.27.t:0 "Edmund Geilenberg"
 germany.27.d:0 "Edmund Geilenberg, one of the most boring men in Germany. He certainly had a history, but it was quite dull. One of supporting the NSDAP early enough to gain numerous promotions and eventually he was appointed as the head of Reichswerke. Reichswerke was much more interesting than its controllers; it's an industrial conglomorate spanning nearly the entire European continent encompassing a large majority of the industry consumed by the Germany industrial base during the second world war. It even had notable presences, in partner nations like Hungary and the North Sea Empire. While this disgusting abominable monster of a corporation was certainly powerful, it was built on foundations of gravel. The entire corporation is state-owned and as such, it is incredibly simple to rework the company to inevitably collapse. Coupled with some international competition and the occasional manual destruction of facilities, it should be a simple matter to take apart Reichswerke piece by piece."
 germany.27.a:0 "Time to make some calls."
 germany.28.t:0 "The Battleship Eliminated"
 germany.28.d:0 "The pressure had gotten to him, he had gone bankrupt. Only in the Monopoly game they were playing of course, but in reality it wasn't a statement far off the mark. Geilenberg has suspected Josef Ab's smirk he wore when he proposed a game of Monopoly, and he had finally started putting the pieces together. The odd reorginization, the rising slave riots, the strange foreign deals... Josef Abs had been playing him like a piece on a board game. Reichswerke was about to be formally incorporated into what Geilenberg suspected would be the new German state industry, IG Farben. Of course, on paper, Reichswerke would stay in the position it had and so would IG Farben, but Geilenberg's personal influence on the board was about to get entirely erased. Finishing his glass of whiskey, Geilenberg grabbed his coat and left the meeting in a hurry. If he were to salvage the current situation, he would need to act fast. He parked his car a couple of blocks away and headed over towards it. He got in and noticed a familiar and odd smell... a deep stench that a smoker would leave in leather seats. Geilenberg personally avoided smoking in his car as to not ruin the seats, and so clearly, someone else had broken in to it. After a quick inspection, nothing seemed to be out of place, and so he put the keys in the ignition and started the car. In the last moments of his life, he recognized that smell; it was the same smell that Josef Ab's servants had from the second hand smoke of his cigars. He had been played. An explosion shook the streets of Germania that night, one powerful enough to sink a battleship for good."

 usa.1.d:0 ""...the Nazis, the Chinese, the Nords... they have driven us to this path. To beat them, we must do so at their own game: that is what we have told ourselves for these past decades. In order for democracy and libery to shine its light on every corner of the world, the menace of fascism must first be outlasted, by whatever means necessary. We must not give up an inch... Yes, this is what we have told ourselves. But, we have already lost. We have stooped to their level. When pushed to the brink, we have given up on our ideals. We have gone astray, in the times it matters most. But I speak to you all today, with a purpose. Today is the day, we walk this path no longer. Today is the day, we, the United States of America, show the fascists what it is in which we believe. Yesterday, American troops opened fire on Japanese civilians protesting our occupation. As of yesterday, the earth mourns the loss of 14 human beings. As of this morning, those troops will be tried. Yesterday, our military supressed dissent in our East Asian holdings. As of noon, I have begun the process of their withdrawal. Yesterday, America had lost its way. But we, my fellow Americans, are better than this. Today, America, we will be better than this.""
