 germany.2.t:0 "The Corporations Rally"
 germany.2.d:0 "Following the NSDAP mutiny, the megacorporations have rallied their allies in the army together to prepare and crush the NSDAP seeing as the current government is failing in their eyes.

 germany.2.a:0 "Scheisse!"
 germany.3.t:0 "The Red Dawn"
 germany.3.d:0 "Seeing the nation collapse into chaos and facitonalism, the underground network of the left coalition has taken the opportunity to try and seize control themselves.

 germany.8.t:0 "The Big Four"
 germany.8.d:0 "Ever since the untimely death of Adolf Hitler, there has been no official leader of Germany. It was quickly decided that since had named no successor and that since no one man would ever live up to the title as Hitler had, a sort-of democracy was set up. Of course, it was not one of those sham democracies such as the United States, only NSDAP officials could gain power. One odd side effect saw the leaders of the big four corporations, IG Farben, Siemens, Reichswerke, and Daimler-Benz, and several of their subordinates reach this new board of politicians. After gaining a majority in the board, the four corporations made a separate board of directors of German industry, and while the original council seated by NSDAP members still nominally held power, the real leaders of Germany became the corporations that day. The corporations however still let the NSDAP run the country as they pleased so there were no complaints."
 germany.8.a:0 "An odd alliance."
 germany.9.t:0 "German Decay"
 germany.9.d:0 "Since Hitler's death, Germany has been on a downturn that it still hasn't recovered from. The poverty line keeps getting lowered by the corporate board every year, but everyone knows that poverty has hit rates near 40%. Slavery has stolen jobs from the average German as Italians continue getting abused for free by the corporations. The corporations, however, have a very fanciful facade of social mobility that the German people have bought into.'Perhaps one day i'll make it big and get on that board...' is what runs through the minds of every German. Unforunately, they've fallen for the ruse hook, line, and sinker. This cannot stay as is, the corporations need to be ousted, but who will stand up and take the challenge? The sad answer is no one."
 germany.9.a:0 "A house of cards ready to fall."
 germany.10.t:0 "The Italian Disaster"
 germany.10.d:0 "Following Hitler's declaration of souther lebensraum, Mussolini scrambled to find allies in a newly German dominated Europe, but his cries were heard by none. Germany first marched into sudtyrol, and then Venice, Turin, Milan, Genoa, and finally, once we had reached Bologna, Mussolini was found dead in a bunker in Rome. News spread quickly and Italy collapsed into mayhem. With enough people to feed the slave-based economy and plenty of fine new land for Germans to settle, the German state watched as Italy burned itself to the ground. Declaring German ownership of all of Italy, outside powers were forced to not intervene, but we didn't finish the conquest. Warlords took power in Italian regions and infighting has not stopped since. In a way it was quite a brilliant plan by Hitler, the Italians were cleansing the land for us, and soon we would swoop in and seize even more land for the German people."
 germany.10.a:0 "The fruit is almost ripe."
 germany.11.t:0 "Testing the Wasserstoffbombe"
 germany.11.d:0 "Soon after America unveiled the power of its 'Hydrogen Bomb' to the world, we set our eyes on the raw power of such a weapon. Nearly a decade after America's first testing of the weapon, we have finally finished our own version of it, dubbed the Wasserstoffbombe. The initial test earlier today proved it was as powerful as its American counterpart. We are back in the nuclear race."
 germany.11.a:0 "They shall tremble in their boots."
 germany.12.t:0 "Germany Tests the Wasserstoffbombe"
 germany.12.d:0 "Nearly a decade after the American tests and unveiling of the hydrogen bomb, Germany has finally matched them with a weapon of their own.

Hopefully, these weapons are never put to use."
 germany.12.a:0 "Terrifying."
 germany.13.t:0 "Sales Report"
 germany.13.d:0 "Hermann Josef Abs sat in his large chair and sifted through the papers on his desk. Once he finally got to the bottom of today's stack, a final paper rested. As he went over it, a slight smirk formed on his face, but only for a moment. He put the paper back down and reached for the phone on his desk. It was time to begin his plan."
 germany.13.a:0 "Germany will forever change, soon enough."
 germany.14.t:0 "The Trial of Heinrich Himmler"
 germany.14.d:0 "The courtroom bustled with activity as numerous groups shouted slurs and insults at each other. The doors burst open and the room fell silent. Himmler was walked in, escorted by guards, to the front of the room. 'Herr Heinrich Himmler, you are found guilty of undermining the party and are sentenced to death by firing squad.' The room sat silent for another moment, before erupting into screams, arguments, and fights. Himmler was dragged out around the back of the courthouse before several gunshots were heard. Josef Abs swirled whiskey around in his glass with another smirk showing after hearing the gunshots from nearby."
 germany.14.a:0 "A monster put to rest."
 germany.15.t:0 "The Dissolution of the National Socialist German Workers' Party"
 germany.15.d:0 "Following the success of Josef Ab's gambit, he decided to push his luck, as he always had. It was time to ensure his total control and power over the German nation. One final step needed to be taken, he would dissolve the NSDAP permanently. It was risky, and there was a chance he'd ruin the empire he had built over the years, but the payoff was too great to pass up. The time was right. He signed the bill and sent it off."
 germany.15.a:0 "One final gambit."
 germany.16.t:0 "NSDAP Dissolved"
 germany.16.d:0 "The German Corporate Board made the decision a few days ago to officially dissovled the NSDAP. This unprecedented move has shocked the world in a mix of good and bad ways. While the nazi menace would finally be killed, the German coporations built on slavery and crime would instead take over. Whether this will be a good turn of events remains to be seen."
 germany.16.a:0 "A shock to be sure!"
