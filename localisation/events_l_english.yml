 germany.1.t:0 "NSDAP Defiant"
 germany.1.d:0 "The NSDAP have begun a large-scale mutiny against the government after the attempt to dissolve the party. The remaining loyal Wehrmacht is trying to take charge of the situation at the present, but seems to be making little to no progess in stopped the uprising. Should Germany fail to supress this impudent show of force, it is likely the nation will collapse into civil war."
 germany.1.a:0 "Declare Martial Law!"
 germany.2.t:0 "The Corporations Rally"
 germany.2.d:0 "Following the NSDAP mutiny, the megacorporations have rallied their allies in the army together to prepare and crush the NSDAP seeing as the current government is failing in their eyes. It has become quite unlikely that these revolts can be crushed, but the situation is still salvagable."
 germany.2.a:0 "Scheisse!"
 germany.3.t:0 "The Red Dawn"
 germany.3.d:0 "Seeing the nation collapse into chaos and facitonalism, the underground network of the left coalition has taken the opportunity to try and seize control themselves. All attempts to quell the unrest have failed and a civil war is all but assured at this point. Little can be done but we shall protect the one thing all Germans can be proud of, Germania."
 germany.3.a:0 "Send the Order!"
 germany.4.t:0 "Wehrmacht Emergency Government"
 germany.4.d:0 "A temporary government has been established in the midst of the current crisis. While we have failed to stave off disaster, we can at least protect some of what's left. Germania has been secured and it seems like numerous edge holdings have also been saved."
 germany.4.a:0 "Let's pray this war end quickly."
 germany.5.t:0 "Allegiances"
 germany.5.d:0 "With the nation on the brink of the civil war, a side must be chosen. Who should the emergency government covertly support?"
 germany.5.a:0 "The Corporations of course! §RYou will tag switch to Corporate Germany upon the start of the war§!"
 germany.5.b:0 "The NSDAP! §RYou will tag switch to NSDAP Germany upon the start of the war§!"
 germany.5.c:0 "The German People! §RYou will tag switch to Peoples' Germany upon the start of the war§!"
 germany.6.t:0 "The German Civil War"
 germany.6.d:0 "After a long and silent morning, the NSDAP began their march to reclaim Germany. Likewise, Peoples' Germany and Corporate Germany also began to move into position. 5 minutes before noon, on the outskirts of Leipzig, the first gunshot fired. The ultimate war to decide the fate of Europe had begun, and there was no stopping it now."
 germany.6.a:0 "To arms!"
 germany.7.t:0 "Border Regions Revolt!"
 germany.7.d:0 "Following the beginning of the German civil war, the various border regions the Wehrmacht was occupying managed to break free of us. Luckily Germania holds strong."
 germany.7.a:0 "They will see vengeance soon..."
 germany.8.t:0 "The Big Four"
 germany.8.d:0 "Ever since the untimely death of Adolf Hitler, there has been no official leader of Germany. It was quickly decided that since had named no successor and that since no one man would ever live up to the title as Hitler had, a sort-of democracy was set up. Of course, it was not one of those sham democracies such as the United States, only NSDAP officials could gain power. One odd side effect saw the leaders of the big four corporations, IG Farben, Siemens, Reichswerke, and Daimler-Benz, and several of their subordinates reach this new board of politicians. After gaining a majority in the board, the four corporations made a separate board of directors of German industry, and while the original council seated by NSDAP members still nominally held power, the real leaders of Germany became the corporations that day. The corporations however still let the NSDAP run the country as they pleased so there were no complaints."
 germany.8.a:0 "An odd alliance."
 germany.9.t:0 "German Decay"
 germany.9.d:0 "Since Hitler's death, Germany has been on a downturn that it still hasn't recovered from. The poverty line keeps getting lowered by the corporate board every year, but everyone knows that poverty has hit rates near 40%. Slavery has stolen jobs from the average German as Italians continue getting abused for free by the corporations. The corporations, however, have a very fanciful facade of social mobility that the German people have bought into.'Perhaps one day i'll make it big and get on that board...' is what runs through the minds of every German. Unforunately, they've fallen for the ruse hook, line, and sinker. This cannot stay as is, the corporations need to be ousted, but who will stand up and take the challenge? The sad answer is no one."
 germany.9.a:0 "A house of cards ready to fall."
 germany.10.t:0 "The Italian Disaster"
 germany.10.d:0 "Following Hitler's declaration of souther lebensraum, Mussolini scrambled to find allies in a newly German dominated Europe, but his cries were heard by none. Germany first marched into sudtyrol, and then Venice, Turin, Milan, Genoa, and finally, once we had reached Bologna, Mussolini was found dead in a bunker in Rome. News spread quickly and Italy collapsed into mayhem. With enough people to feed the slave-based economy and plenty of fine new land for Germans to settle, the German state watched as Italy burned itself to the ground. Declaring German ownership of all of Italy, outside powers were forced to not intervene, but we didn't finish the conquest. Warlords took power in Italian regions and infighting has not stopped since. In a way it was quite a brilliant plan by Hitler, the Italians were cleansing the land for us, and soon we would swoop in and seize even more land for the German people."
 germany.10.a:0 "The fruit is almost ripe."
 germany.11.t:0 "Testing the Wasserstoffbombe"
 germany.11.d:0 "Soon after America unveiled the power of its 'Hydrogen Bomb' to the world, we set our eyes on the raw power of such a weapon. Nearly a decade after America's first testing of the weapon, we have finally finished our own version of it, dubbed the Wasserstoffbombe. The initial test earlier today proved it was as powerful as its American counterpart. We are back in the nuclear race."
 germany.11.a:0 "They shall tremble in their boots."
 germany.12.t:0 "Germany Tests the Wasserstoffbombe"
 germany.12.d:0 "Nearly a decade after the American tests and unveiling of the hydrogen bomb, Germany has finally matched them with a weapon of their own. Both nations now possess modern weapons of mass destruction. While the cold war seemed to have finally been drawing to a close, Germany just renewed the struggle, at the cost of global fear. Hopefully, these weapons are never put to use."
 germany.12.a:0 "Terrifying."
 germany.13.t:0 "Sales Report"
 germany.13.d:0 "Hermann Josef Abs sat in his large chair and sifted through the papers on his desk. Once he finally got to the bottom of today's stack, a final paper rested. As he went over it, a slight smirk formed on his face, but only for a moment. He put the paper back down and reached for the phone on his desk. It was time to begin his plan."
 germany.13.a:0 "Germany will forever change, soon enough."
 germany.14.t:0 "The Trial of Heinrich Himmler"
 germany.14.d:0 "The courtroom bustled with activity as numerous groups shouted slurs and insults at each other. The doors burst open and the room fell silent. Himmler was walked in, escorted by guards, to the front of the room. 'Herr Heinrich Himmler, you are found guilty of undermining the party and are sentenced to death by firing squad.' The room sat silent for another moment, before erupting into screams, arguments, and fights. Himmler was dragged out around the back of the courthouse before several gunshots were heard. Josef Abs swirled whiskey around in his glass with another smirk showing after hearing the gunshots from nearby."
 germany.14.a:0 "A monster put to rest."
 germany.15.t:0 "The Dissolution of the National Socialist German Workers' Party"
 germany.15.d:0 "Following the success of Josef Ab's gambit, he decided to push his luck, as he always had. It was time to ensure his total control and power over the German nation. One final step needed to be taken, he would dissolve the NSDAP permanently. It was risky, and there was a chance he'd ruin the empire he had built over the years, but the payoff was too great to pass up. The time was right. He signed the bill and sent it off."
 germany.15.a:0 "One final gambit."
 germany.16.t:0 "NSDAP Dissolved"
 germany.16.d:0 "The German Corporate Board made the decision a few days ago to officially dissovled the NSDAP. This unprecedented move has shocked the world in a mix of good and bad ways. While the nazi menace would finally be killed, the German coporations built on slavery and crime would instead take over. Whether this will be a good turn of events remains to be seen."
 germany.16.a:0 "A shock to be sure!"
 germany.17.t:0 "The German Civil War"
 germany.17.d:0 "Following rising tensions in the German state, a full-blown civil war has erupted between numerous feuding factions. Initial reports have said the three main factions are that of the NSDAP, led by Martin Bormann, a corporate coalition, led by Hermann Josef Abs, and a democratic revolt, led by Konrad Adenauer. On top of the actual heartland of Germany's land collapsing into civil war, there also seem to be numerous revolts and revolutions on the edges of their empire. This instability in Europe has created a perfect opportunity for outside powers to make important moves, although the question still stands: Will they be willing to risk such intervention?"
 germany.17.a:0 "Nervous eyes watch over Germania."
 germany.18.t:0 "german cw event"
 germany.18.d:0 "i hope you don't see this"
 germany.18.a:0 "well i did"
 germany.19.t:0 "A Fabulous Display"
 germany.19.d:0 "The German Corporate Board has ruled all NSDAP members and all left-wing partisans as enemies of the state, the penalty for which is death. Screams echo through the streets as gunfire rings in every person's ears. A scene even more disturbing than the civil war itself has unfolded right in front of each and every German. Nearly every town, city, and village in Germany has a body pile, some larger than others, but the one thing they have in common is being made up of Germans and the fate they'll soon meet in incinerators."
 germany.19.a:0 "Well deserved."
 germany.20.t:0 "The Centerpiece"
 germany.20.d:0 "A public courtroom was set up in the center of Berlin, with thousands gathered around it. The once most powerful men in Germany, the highest ranking members of the NSDAP, now rest on their knees, hands and legs bound, in front of a content crowd. The corporations had managed to successfully demonize the NSDAP, the very people who brought Germany salvation, and now they were about to end the party once and for all. Bormann looked up, ignoring the judge reading their crimes against Germany. His time was about to come, and there was nothing he could do to stop it. Instead, he smiled, for he was about to rejoin an old friend he hadn't seen in a long time. A tear nearly formed from his eye before it all went black. Bormann's corpse now lay on the stage as the crowd cheered."
 germany.20.a:0 "Another monster gone."
 germany.21.t:0 "Cleaning Up the Mess"
 germany.21.d:0 "With the main opposition to the state eliminated, it was time to begin work on fixing the plights of the German people. The slaves had become severely unmotivated since the leftist revolt promised them freedom, but that wasn't something a smart man like Josef Abs couldn't fix. As well as fixing the production slough, a new bureau of internal affairs was set to be created, although it was to be made via IG Farben and not through the German government. This raised some eyes at the corporate board, but there was nothing they could do about it anyway."
 germany.21.a:0 "A brighter future awaits!"
 
 #PACIFIC
 usa.1.t:0 "Kennedy's Address"
 usa.1.d:0 ""...the Nazis, the Chinese, the Nords... they have driven us to this path. To beat them, we must do so at their own game: that is what we have told ourselves for these past decades. In order for democracy and libery to shine its light on every corner of the world, the menace of fascism must first be outlasted, by whatever means necessary. We must not give up an inch... Yes, this is what we have told ourselves. But, we have already lost. We have stooped to their level. When pushed to the brink, we have given up on our ideals. We have gone astray, in the times it matters most. But I speak to you all today, with a purpose. Today is the day, we walk this path no longer. Today is the day, we, the United States of America, show the fascists what it is in which we believe. Yesterday, American troops opened fire on Japanese civilians protesting our occupation. As of yesterday, the earth mourns the loss of 14 human beings. As of this morning, those troops will be tried. Yesterday, our military supressed dissent in our East Asian holdings. As of noon, I have begun the process of their withdrawal. Yesterday, America had lost its way. But we, my fellow Americans, are better than this. Today, America, we will be better than this.""
